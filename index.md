## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

Hi! I'm a senior studying Electrical Engineering & Computer Science @ MIT. I'm currently focusing my studies on robotics. Outside of school, I like to make art in the form of piano, bachata, fire spinning, or singing in choir.

## Research Interests

I'm interested in robotics, especially synthesizing agile controllers for underactuated systems, and bio-inspired robots. I'm also interested in optimization and numerical methods, especially semi-definite optimization.
