## Uneven Bars Robot

This was my final project for 6.8210 (Underactuated Robotics). The goal was to synthesize a controller for a robot to perform in the uneven bars gymnastics event. Specifically, to swing from a still position and jump from the high to the low bar.

The controller was designed to minimize the total energy spent and synthesized via non-linear optimization. The hardest part to figure out was how to model what happens when the robot loses contact with the bar, since the dynamics change. The solution was to treat the point of contact with the bar as a free-moving joint that is locked in place until release. Feel free to read the detailed report here.

## Robotics: Science & Systems Racecar

Throughout the semester in 6.141, students work in a team to develop the functionality of a racecar the staff gives to us at the start of the semester. By the end of the semester, the car is capable of wall following, basic vision, localization, and trajectory planning and following. The cars then completes a race around a 400m racetrack as well as an autonomous driving challenge.
Our car Sonny (short for son-of-a-bitch) was able to complete the race track at 4 m/s (the maximum speed staff allowed us to use) as well as the driving challenge. For more details on Sonny, please see our team's website.
